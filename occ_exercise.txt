Some notes/explanations/etc.

- Another department will want to use this utility as well, but they have a much more complex name scoring algorithm.

  Created an interface called ScoringAlgorithm.  This will allow them to implement their algorithm.  Ideally, we'd be 
  able to switch or use a specific algorithm without a code change.  Either in a config file or a param passed in.  
  
  
- The scoring feature will be added to the company's intranet web-app allowing employees to upload and score files from their desktop

  If we are reading from the intranet, we'd need to give the option to read from an InputStream/Channel/etc. This would need a change 
  in the InputFileReader class and open a socket waiting for data to come in.  Then, read the data, calculate the results and return the value.     
 
  
- The company will be switching from first names only to both first and last name in the file
  I added options for both (first name only and first/last name). 
  
 
This is single threaded but if latency is a concern, we may be able to use multithreading to speed this up assuming we have idle cores.     
  
  
  
Libraries I used:
- junit 4.9 
- slf4j-api 1.7.25 
- slf4j-simple 1.7.25
